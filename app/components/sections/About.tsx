            I&apos;m a self-taught web developer with a passion for building fast,
            modern, and user-friendly applications. My journey began with
            Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase, where I crafted responsive
            frontends with sleek designs. As my curiosity grew, I dove into
            backend development, mastering Express.js, MongoDB, and
            Node.jsâ€”building robust APIs and ensuring seamless data flow with
            Postman. <br /> 
            What drives me? Problem-solving, clean code, and continuous
            learning. I thrive on turning ideas into reality, whether it&apos;s a
            dynamic full-stack app or an optimized UI. My goal? To join a team
            where I can contribute my skills, grow as a developer, and create
            impactful digital experiences. Let&apos;s build something amazing
            together!
